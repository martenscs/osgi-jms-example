This example demonstrates how to add and remove JMS listeners dynamically in an OSGi container

How to use this example:
1. Clone the git repository
2. Import all projects into your Eclipse workspace
3. Open osgijms.target and click on 'Set as target platform'
   The workspace should compile now
4. Start an ActiveMq Server that accepts connections at tcp://localhost:61616
5. Run the pre-configured "OSGi JMS-Example" launcher from the Run menu
   The OSGi server starts and waits for JMS messages
6. Start the client by running Main in nh.osgijms.client
7. Send messages using the simple client

You can start and stop the nh.osgijms.message_v1 and nh.osgijms.message_v2 bundles anytime you want. When they are started they wait for jms messages, when they are shutdown, they remove the JMS listener.
